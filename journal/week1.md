# Stretched Homework
  - using the GitPod documentation, I changed gitpod port visibility to public in .gitpod.yml file
  ```
  ports:
  - name: Backend
    port: 4567
    visibility: public
  - name: Frontend
    port: 3000
    visibility: public
  - name: Dynamodb
    port: 8000
    visibility: public
  - name: Postgres
    port: 5432
    visibility: public
  ```
 - Added npm install to .gitpod.yaml file to all npm be automatically installed on launching gitpod
 ```
 - name: npm-install
    init: |
      cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/frontend-react-js
      npm install
  ```
